"""River Air flight recovery data: 30 days of history plus one live day at the SFO hub.

Each service day has 180 flights: 90 arrivals into SFO and 90 departures from it. Every
flight uses one 182-seat layout, modeled after a two-class Boeing 737-900ER, and each
passenger has a seat on each of their flights.
The live day is shifted so flight RA417 from Chicago is scheduled 50 minutes after the
stream starts. Its delay grows every 30 seconds from +5 to +25 minutes, and 150 of its 170
passengers miss their connection. Every active flight publishes its status once a minute
(RA417 every 30 seconds), en-route arrivals revise their estimate by a minute or two along
the way, and both hotels publish their rooms every 15 seconds. Announced delays only grow
(a severe delay may shrink by at most three minutes near landing), so a flight never goes
from hours late back to on time.

The generator writes two rebooking offers a few seconds after a connection becomes HIGH
risk. Past bookings are completed the way customers would complete them; RA417's offers
stay open for the presenter. When the recovery agent runs in Flink (sql/26-31), it writes
RA417's offers and the generator writes every other flight's.

    uv run airport-datagen                  # history + live day, then stream 90 minutes
    uv run airport-datagen --offers generator  # write RA417's offers even if the agent runs
    uv run airport-datagen --speed 5        # play the 90-minute stream in 18 minutes
    uv run airport-datagen --minutes 0      # publish the current state and exit
    uv run airport-datagen --dry-run --skip-history --minutes 5
    uv run airport-datagen --reset          # tombstone every generated key
