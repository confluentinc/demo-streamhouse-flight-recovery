# Optional, same pattern as core's Bedrock connection: aws_tableflow_* creds are
# passed explicitly (never a tracked file) rather than relying on an ambient AWS
# CLI session. When they're empty, keynote-analytics.tf's resources are all
# count = 0 (see local.keynote_analytics_enabled in main.tf) and the skip_*
# flags below stop the provider from ever calling AWS (no STS
# GetCallerIdentity at init). skip_credentials_validation alone isn't enough —
# the AWS provider still falls through to the ambient SSO/IMDS credential
# chain if access_key/secret_key are empty, which fails loudly when that
# chain is ALSO empty/expired (as it should be allowed to be, since this
# whole path is meant to be optional). Obviously-fake placeholder credentials
# avoid that fallthrough entirely: they're never validated or used, since
# skip_credentials_validation is set and every AWS resource is count = 0.
